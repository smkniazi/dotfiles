# rsync through multiple hops
A -> B -> C

```A> rsync -arzvh -e "ssh -A -J BsUser@B:BsPort"  inputFile CsUser@C:/dest```


# tar & pigz

```tar cf /paths-to-archive | pigz -9 -p 32 > /archive.tar.gz```

-0 is no compression  
-1 is low compression  
-9 is best compression and it is darn slow  
-p 32 is the number of threads


# Reverse SSH

A wants to connect to B but  B is behind a firewall.  B opens a reverse ssh port on A to communicate with B

On B 

``` B> autossh -f -N  -M 41657 -R 6135:localhost:22 AsUser@AsAddress -p 22 ```
This will open port `6135` on A. `autossh` will keep the connection open if there are temporary network failures and `-f -n` switch will run autossh in the background. 

On A

```A> ssh -p 6135 BsUser@localhost ```

** Multiple hops **

Assume C has access to A and it wants to communicate with B

```C> ssh -A -t AsUser@AsAddress -A -t ssh localhost -p 6135```


# vim show white spaces

start vim with `-b` option

```vim -b file```


# Insert line numbers in a file

``` nl file ```

# All git branches that contains the COMMIT ID

``` git branch  -r --contains COMMIT_ID ```

# git search the commit log (across all branches) for the given text:

``` git log --all --grep='elixir of life'```

To search the actual content of commits through a repo's history, use:

``` git grep 'elixir of life' $(git rev-list --all)```

or

``` git rev-list --all  | xargs git grep 'elixir of life' ```
